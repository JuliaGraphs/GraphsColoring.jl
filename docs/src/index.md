# GraphColoring

Graph coloring is a technique used to avoid conflicts between elements in a graph. The goal is to assign colors to the elements such that no two neighboring elements have the same color.
Currently, the following aspects are implemented (✓) and planned (⌛):

- ✓ [Greedy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/graph-coloring-set-2-greedy-algorithm/)
- ✓ [DSATUR (Degree SATURated)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/dsatur-algorithm-for-graph-coloring/)
- ✓ [Workstream](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2851488)
- ⌛ Random (and iterative random coloring)
- ⌛ First-Fit Coloring
